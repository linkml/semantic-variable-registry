## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| 10th Percentile | Quantile at 10% of distribution |  |  |
| 1st Percentile | Quantile at 1% of distribution |  |  |
| 25th Percentile | Quantile at 25% of distribution |  |  |
| 5th Percentile | Quantile at 5% of distribution |  |  |
| 75th Percentile | Quantile at 75% of distribution |  |  |
| 90th Percentile | Quantile at 90% of distribution |  |  |
| 95th Percentile | Quantile at 95% of distribution |  |  |
| 99th Percentile | Quantile at 99% of distribution |  |  |
| Maximum | Maximum value |  |  |
| Mean | Average (mean) value of sample population |  |  |
| Measurement Uncertainty | Report uncertainty as a plus or minus value in the measurement units. For example, enter 1.5 for +/- 1.5 units. Uncertainty may be reported from the instrument's specifications, determined empirically, or estimated by the tower team. Please describe such details in Approach. For uncertainty values that are better described by a range, a percent, or other, please enter information in Comments. |  |  |
| Median - 50th Percentile | Median - Quantile at 50% of distribution |  |  |
| Minimum | Minimum value |  |  |
| Single observation | Single observation that is not a calculated statistic of replicates either to get a robust estimate or for spatial variability analysis. For example a single biomass observation may be the vegetation harvested in a single 1 x 1 meter area. |  |  |
| Standard Deviation | Standard deviation may be reported from a sample population that consists of individual or aggregated samples (observations). If the distinction is important, specify in STATISTIC_METHOD or Comments. |  |  |
