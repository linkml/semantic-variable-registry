| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Aggregate of individual observations | The statistic is aggregated from individual observations located within the site. Observations may be grouped into sample areas (e.g., plots) within the site but those groupings are ignored. Statistics generated from individual observations directly yield information on the site generally. The statistic may represent spatial characteristics of the measurement within the site (e.g., spatial heterogeneity) and/or characteristics due to other factors (e.g., population variability). |  |  |
| Aggregate of sample aggregates | The statistic is aggregated from aggregated individual observations located in sample areas within the site. For example, individual observations are made in 5 sample plots within a site. "Aggregate of sample aggregates" is used if a plot statistic (e.g., Mean) is first calculated, and then the plot values are aggregated to calculate the site statistic. Statistics generated by this approach are often used to highlight the spatial characteristics within the site (i.e., the spatial heterogeneity of measurement within the site). |  |  |
| Expert estimate | Estimate made by expert familiar with site |  |  |
