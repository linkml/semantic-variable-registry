STATISTIC	Mean	Average (mean) value of sample population
STATISTIC	Standard Deviation	Standard deviation may be reported from a sample population that consists of individual or aggregated samples (observations). If the distinction is important, specify in STATISTIC_METHOD or Comments.
STATISTIC	Minimum	Minimum value
STATISTIC	1st Percentile	Quantile at 1% of distribution
STATISTIC	5th Percentile	Quantile at 5% of distribution
STATISTIC	10th Percentile	Quantile at 10% of distribution
STATISTIC	25th Percentile	Quantile at 25% of distribution
STATISTIC	Median - 50th Percentile	Median - Quantile at 50% of distribution
STATISTIC	75th Percentile	Quantile at 75% of distribution
STATISTIC	90th Percentile	Quantile at 90% of distribution
STATISTIC	95th Percentile	Quantile at 95% of distribution
STATISTIC	99th Percentile	Quantile at 99% of distribution
STATISTIC	Maximum	Maximum value
STATISTIC	Single observation	Single observation that is not a calculated statistic of replicates either to get a robust estimate or for spatial variability analysis. For example a single biomass observation may be the vegetation harvested in a single 1 x 1 meter area.
STATISTIC	Measurement Uncertainty	Report uncertainty as a plus or minus value in the measurement units. For example, enter 1.5 for +/- 1.5 units. Uncertainty may be reported from the instrument's specifications, determined empirically, or estimated by the tower team. Please describe such details in Approach. For uncertainty values that are better described by a range, a percent, or other, please enter information in Comments.
STATISTIC_METHOD	Aggregate of individual observations	The statistic is aggregated from individual observations located within the site. Observations may be grouped into sample areas (e.g., plots) within the site but those groupings are ignored. Statistics generated from individual observations directly yield information on the site generally. The statistic may represent spatial characteristics of the measurement within the site (e.g., spatial heterogeneity) and/or characteristics due to other factors (e.g., population variability).
STATISTIC_METHOD	Aggregate of sample aggregates	"The statistic is aggregated from aggregated individual observations located in sample areas within the site. For example, individual observations are made in 5 sample plots within a site. ""Aggregate of sample aggregates"" is used if a plot statistic (e.g., Mean) is first calculated, and then the plot values are aggregated to calculate the site statistic. Statistics generated by this approach are often used to highlight the spatial characteristics within the site (i.e., the spatial heterogeneity of measurement within the site)."
