      Measurement Uncertainty:
        description: Report uncertainty as a plus or minus value in the measurement
          units. For example, enter 1.5 for +/- 1.5 units. Uncertainty may be reported
          from the instrument's specifications, determined empirically, or estimated
          by the tower team. Please describe such details in Approach. For uncertainty
          values that are better described by a range, a percent, or other, please
          enter information in Comments.

      Single observation:
        description: Single observation that is not a calculated statistic of replicates
          either to get a robust estimate or for spatial variability analysis. For
          example a single biomass observation may be the vegetation harvested in
          a single 1 x 1 meter area.
      Standard Deviation:
        description: Standard deviation may be reported from a sample population that
          consists of individual or aggregated samples (observations). If the distinction
          is important, specify in STATISTIC_METHOD or Comments.
  STATISTIC_METHOD:
    from_schema: TEMP
    permissible_values:
      Aggregate of individual observations:
        description: The statistic is aggregated from individual observations located
          within the site. Observations may be grouped into sample areas (e.g., plots)
          within the site but those groupings are ignored. Statistics generated from
          individual observations directly yield information on the site generally.
          The statistic may represent spatial characteristics of the measurement within
          the site (e.g., spatial heterogeneity) and/or characteristics due to other
          factors (e.g., population variability).
      Aggregate of sample aggregates:
        description: The statistic is aggregated from aggregated individual observations
          located in sample areas within the site. For example, individual observations
          are made in 5 sample plots within a site. "Aggregate of sample aggregates"
          is used if a plot statistic (e.g., Mean) is first calculated, and then the
          plot values are aggregated to calculate the site statistic. Statistics generated
          by this approach are often used to highlight the spatial characteristics
          within the site (i.e., the spatial heterogeneity of measurement within the
          site).
